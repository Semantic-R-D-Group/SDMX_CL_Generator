def parse_xml_to_ttl_from_url(xml_url, old_model_url, new_model_doc, new_model_url, ttl_output, codelist_output, tuning_output, comment_output, include_context=False, tuning = True):
    """Main function for parsing XML, loading the old model, and generating a new RDF model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xml_url : str
        URL of the XML document containing the source concepts.
    old_model_url : str
        URL of the old model in Turtle format, used for comparison.
    new_model_doc: str
        URL of the documentation for the new model.
    new_model_url : str
        URL of the new model to be created.
    ttl_output : str
        Path to save the generated Turtle file (TTL).
    codelist_output : str
        Path to save the CSV file with codelist associations.
    tuning_output : str
        Path to save the file with additional data for tuning.
    comment_output : str
        Path to save comments about concepts (for translation).
    include_context : bool
        Flag indicating whether to include context annotations in the model (default: `False`).
    tuning : bool
        Flag to enable tuning mode, which records additional data about concepts (default: `True`).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[int, int]
        A tuple of two values:
        1. Number of processed concepts.
        2. Total number of `skos:broader` relations found in the concepts.

    Raises
    ------
    Error
        Describe raised exceptions (if any).

    See Also
    --------
    other_functions
        Describe references to other modules/functions.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Loads the XML document and the RDF graph of the old model.
    2. Defines namespaces for processing XML and RDF data.
    3. Extracts concepts from the XML document.
    4. Builds the new RDF model, including prefixes, concept scheme, and relationships between concepts.
    5. Writes the RDF model in Turtle format.
    6. Creates a CSV file with codelist associations.
    7. Performs tuning and compares concept IDs between the new and old models.
    8. Outputs a list of concepts for which additional comparison with the old model can be analyzed.
