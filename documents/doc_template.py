    """Main function for parsing XML, loading the old model, and generating a new RDF model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xml_url : str
        URL of the XML document containing the source concepts.
    old_model_url : str
        URL of the old model in Turtle format, used for comparison.
    new_model_doc: str
        URL of the documentation for the new model.
    new_model_url : str
        URL of the new model to be created.
    ttl_output : str
        Path to save the generated Turtle file (TTL).
    codelist_output : str
        Path to save the CSV file with codelist associations.
    tuning_output : str
        Path to save the file with additional tuning data.
    comment_output : str
        Path to save comments about concepts (for translation).
    include_context : bool
        Flag indicating whether to include context annotations in the model (default: `False`).
    tuning : bool
        Flag to enable tuning mode, which records additional data about concepts (default: `True`).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[int, int]
        A tuple of two values:
        1. Number of processed concepts.
        2. Total number of `skos:broader` relations found in the concepts.

    Raises
    ------
    Error
        Describe raised exceptions (if any).

    --------
    other_functions
        Provide references to other modules/functions.

    Notes
    -----
    #. Loads the XML document and RDF graph of the old model.
    #. Defines namespaces for processing XML and RDF data.
    #. Extracts concepts from the XML document.
    #. Builds the new RDF model, including prefixes, the concept scheme, and relationships between concepts.
    #. Writes the RDF model in Turtle format.
    #. Creates a CSV file with codelist associations.
    #. Performs tuning and compares concept IDs between the new and old models.
    #. Outputs a list of concepts for which further comparison with the old model can be analyzed.

    **Limitations**
        - Requires an accessible XML file and an old RDF model.
        - May take significant time when processing a large number of concepts.

    **Dependencies**
        - datetime.date
        - rdflib.Namespace
        - loader_parse_xml_ttl_from_url (from loadparser)
        - extract_xml_content (from xml_extractor)
        - write_codelist_csv (from cl_concept_writer)
        - process_concepts (from logic_triplets)
        - compare_ID (from tuning)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> parse_xml_to_ttl_from_url(
        "https://example.com/concepts.xml",

        include_context=True,
        tuning=True
    )

    Yields
    ------
    int
        The next number in the range of 0 to `n` - 1.
